Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna\'s sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It\'s a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can\'t stop. She fears she\'s becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.','English, Icelandic','USA','Won 2 Oscars.

Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy, plastic girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didn\'t expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she\'s ever met. He\'s nothing like anyone she\'s ever met, period. He\'s intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn\'t like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn\'t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he\'s immortal. That\'s right - vampire. But he doesn\'t have fangs - that\'s just in the movies. And he doesn\'t drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella? A modern, visual, and visceral Romeo and Juliet story of the ultimate forbidden love affair - between vampire and mortal.','English','USA','26 wins & 11 nominations.','http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzUxMTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEyMTIwMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg',56,5.2,333,'tt1099212','movie','True',1,1449221424,1449221424),(6,'2 States',2014,'NOT RATED','18 Apr 2014','149 min','Comedy, Drama, Romance','Abhishek Varman','Chetan Bhagat (story), Abhishek Varman (screenplay','Arjun Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Amrita Singh, Revathy','A story about a romantic journey of a culturally opposite couple - Krish Malhotra and Ananya Swaminathan.
